 - Earlier access to information and testing report
 - Reduced test execution time, faster time to market
 - More time for new tests for testers

### Potential risks of automation tools:
 - Unrealistic expectation on the benefit of the tool
 - Inaccurate estimations of time, cost and effort required to manage test scripts
 - Using tool when manual testing is more appropriate
 - Relying on tool so much and ignoring the human's critical thinking
 - Dependency on the tool
 - Unsuitable or non compatible tool selection
